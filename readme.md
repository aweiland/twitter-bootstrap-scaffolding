# Twitter Bootstrap Scaffolding

This is an experimental Grails project using Twitter Bootstrap for scaffolded views.  It has been updated to 
work with Grails 2.4.2 and the lastest version of the twitter bootstrap plugin.

## Demo

This demo seems dead
[Check out the demo](http://grails-twitter-bootstrap.cloudfoundry.com) on Cloud Foundry.

## Installation

You can either use this project as a template or to add to an existing Grails application:

1. Install the _Twitter Bootstrap Resources_ plugin, i.e. add `runtime ":twitter-bootstrap:3.2.1"` to _BuildConfig.groovy_.
2. Install the _Fields_ plugin, i.e. add `runtime ":fields:1.3"` to _BuildConfig.groovy_.
3. Copy the following files into your Grails application.
   * `src/templates/scaffolding/*` 
   * `grails-app/assets/**/*`
   * `grails-app/taglib/**/*`
   * `grails-app/views/index.gsp`
   * `grails-app/views/layouts/bootstrap.gsp`
   * `grails-app/views/_fields/default/_field.gsp`
   
   
Using this project as a template is the easiest way to get running quickly.
   
## TODO

The scaffolding still needs to be updated to Bootstrap 3.x.
